# GravityBall
An android app which simulates the motion of a ball on a surface which changes along with the orientation (pitch and roll) of the device. 
The GravityBall project is based mainly on the project by https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-advanced/tree/master/TiltSpot, with some minor modifications.
